                <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the
                    family
                    Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.
                    The
                    cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human
                    contact. A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents.
                    About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

                    Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,
                    sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most
                    active
                    at dawn and dusk (crepuscular). Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human
                    ears,
                    such as those made by mice and other small animals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark
                    and have a better sense of smell, but poorer color vision.

                    Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two
                    to
                    five kittens. Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat
                    fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment
                    of
                    pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide.
